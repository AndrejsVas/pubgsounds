    <hr>
    <p class="disclaimerText"> The aim of this project is to help players learn and recognize the different weapon sounds present in the game.
        Correctly identifying the weapons shot and its range is crucial for tracking enemy combatants as well as understanding positioning
        and is a vital part of tactical planing.</p>
    <p class="disclaimerText">
    The range slider allows to hear the weapon at different ranges and radio buttons are available to switch between firing
    modes and silenced mode.</p>
    <h1 class="disclaimerHeader">Methodology</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="disclaimerText">Each weapon required recording replays of the various shooting modes and silencers ingame and then recording the sounds of
        the replays , the crate weapons are currently missing because of the hardships of recording them ,
        however they might appear in the future.
    </p>
    <p class="disclaimerText">
        All audio recordings have been made ingame and some of the maximum audible ranges
        could be barely audible
        and may require adjusting your volume. The background noise present in the sound recordings is part
        of the
        ingame audio background and cannot be removed without affecting the weapon sounds.
    </p>
    <p class="disclaimerText">
        Sound was recorded with the HRTF function on , if you play with that function off then some of the
        distances will sound a bit different , particularly the echoes.
